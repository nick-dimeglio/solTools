# solTools
Tools for the solana network, at the moment mostly revolving around the Magic Eden marketplace.

# Currently Available
At the moment, the currently usable functions within this build are:
 - Floorprice Check:
      - Check as many floor prices separated by commas at once
      - Automatically save the previous search, so all you don't need to keep entering the same collections.

# Additions Planned
For the future, I want to add a few features that would help potential buyers a bit more closely:
- Price History
- Volume Notifications
- Discord Bot Integration for constant updates
- Firebase/Database integration for centralized data of the collections.
